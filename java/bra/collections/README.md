## Basic List Operations
#### 1. To-Do List
Create a class called "TaskList" that has a list of tasks as an attribute. Each task is represented by a class called "Task" that has a description attribute. Implement the following methods:

  -  `addTask(String description)`: 	Adds a new task to the list with the provided description.
  -  `removeTask(String description)`: 	Removes a task from the list based on its description.
  -  `getTaskQuantity()`: 	Returns the total number of tasks in the list.
  -  `getTaskDescriptions()`: 	Returns a list containing the description of all tasks in the list.

#### 2. Shopping CartList Search
Create a class called "ShoppingCart" that represents an online shopping cart. The cart should be implemented as a list of items. Each item is represented by a class called "Item" that has attributes such as name, price, and quantity. Implement the following methods:

  -  `addItem(String name, double price, int quantity)`: 	Adds an item to the cart with the specified name, price, and quantity.
  -  `removeItem(String name)`: 	Removes an item from the cart based on its name.
  -  `calculateTotalValue()`: 	Calculates and returns the total value of the cart, taking into account the price and quantity of each item.
  -  `displayItems()`: 	Displays all items in the cart, showing their names, prices and quantities.

#### 1. Book Catalog
