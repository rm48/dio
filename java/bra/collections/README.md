## Basic List Operations
#### 1. To-Do List

Create a class called "TaskList" that has a list of tasks as an attribute. Each task is represented by a class called "Task" that has a description attribute. Implement the following methods:

  -  `addTask(String description)`: 	Adds a new task to the list with the provided description.
  -  `removeTask(String description)`: 	Removes a task from the list based on its description.
  -  `getTaskQuantity()`: 	Returns the total number of tasks in the list.
  -  `getTaskDescriptions()`: 	Returns a list containing the description of all tasks in the list.
